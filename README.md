### ðŸ’» How it works

#### The application developed, called Recipe Evaluation, is a REST based application whose purpose is to store evaluations to recipes. A user can register as many evaluations as he wants for different recipes with the informations of  date the evaluation and stars the recipe deserve. But, the evaluation of a recipe can only be registered if the recipe is already registered in the external API (Tasty).

- To verify if a recipe is already registered:
#### GET https://tasty.p.rapidapi.com/recipes/auto-complete

With the recipe registered in the external API, we can start registering of an evaluations.

- To read all evaluations from Recipe Evaluation:
#### GET http://localhost:8081/evaluation

- To read only one evaluation in Recipe Evaluation:
#### GET http://localhost:8081/evaluation//recipe?id={{recipeId}}

- To register a new evaluation:
#### POST http://localhost:8081/evaluation
```	
{
	"recipeId": "chocolate cake",
	"evaluations": {
		"2022-03-10": 5
	}
}
```

- To delete the cache:
#### DELETE http://localhost:8081/evaluation/cache
